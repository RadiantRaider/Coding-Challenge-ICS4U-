This creative aspect will change the Lorenz Attractor's colour based on the position of the mouse. This code is taken from Khan Academy's
"Magnitude Visualizer" challenge, and will be used to help put the colour changing code into the code for the Lorenz Attractor.

mouseMoved = function() {
    background(255, 255, 255);
    
    var mouse = new PVector(mouseX, mouseY);
    
    stroke(255, 0, 0);
    strokeWeight(3);
    line(0, 0, mouse.x, mouse.y);
    
    var m = mouse.mag();
    fill(0, 0, 0);
    text(m, mouse.x, mouse.y);
    
    var d = dist(width, height, 0, 0);
    var n = map(m, 0, d, 0, 255);
    background(n, n, n);
};
